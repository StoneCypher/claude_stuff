# claude_stuff

These are my public Claude things - agents, slash commands, skills, hooks, and so on.  They're a small grab 
bag of things that I find useful.  I hope that they can help you too.

If you want these attached to your local user account, for all projects, put them in `~/.claude` in the 
appropriate subdirectory (commands go in `~/.claude/commands`, agents in `~/.claude/agents`, et cetera.)  

If you want these attached to your project, for all team members, put them in `%projectroot%/.claude/whatever`.  

I accept contributions.
