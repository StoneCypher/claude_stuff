# claude_slash_commands

These are my public Claude slash commands.  They're a small grab bag of things that I find useful.  I hope
that they can help you too.

If you want these attached to your local user account, for all projects, put them in `~/.claude/commands`.  

If you want these attached to your project, for all team members, put them in `%projectroot%/.claude/commands`.  

I accept contributions.
